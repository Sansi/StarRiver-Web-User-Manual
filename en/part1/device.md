##  Controller Configuration

A controller is a physical device that controls a set of lamps.  Always add a controller before adding a lamp.

### Add a Controller

1. Select  `Device` - `Controller` - `+ Add Controller` to add a controller.  A dialog box will pop up as shown in the figure below.

2. After filling the required fields, `Name`, `Device address`, `IP address`, `Port ` and `remarks` in the dialogbox, click on `Submit` to apply the change.

![Add an Controller](img/device_addController.png 'Add controller')


### Edit a Controller

1. Select `Device` - `Controller`. Locate the target controller and then click on the ![Edit](img\Edit.png 'Edit') (pencil-shaped) button which can be found in the responding row in the controller table.  A dialog box will pop up as shown in the figure below. 
2. After changing the desired item of the controller profile, `Name`, `Device address`, `IP address`, or `Port `  in the dialogbox, click on `Submit` to update.

  ![Edit an Controller](img/device_editController.png 'Edit controller')


### Delete a Controller

1. Select `Devices` - `Controller` .  Locate the target controller and then click on the ![Delete](img\Trash bin.png 'Delete') (bin-shaped) button which can be found in the responding row in the controller table.  
2. To make sure it's not a mistaken operation, the system would have you click on the  `confirm` button in the popping-up confirmation box, as shown in the figure below.

![Delete controller](img/device_delController.png 'Delete controller')

### Give Location Info. for an Controller

1. Select `Devices` - `Controller` , Locate the controller and then click on the![Location](img/Location.png 'Location') (arrow-shape) button which can be found in the corresponding row in the controller table. 
2. After giving the `latitude` and `longitude` in the popping-up dialog box click on the `Submit` button, as shown below.

   > **Note**:  The field will hightlight in red and refuse to  submit when put into invalid value.

## Lamp Management

This section will provide instruction on lamp management, including adding a lamp, editing the profile of a lamp and deleting a lamp. You will find the procdedures of hadling a lamp is very similiar to those of handling a controller. 


![Configuration lamp](img/device_configLamp.png 'Configuration lamp')

> **Note**: Try refresh when the newly added lamp does not show up in the lamp list.

## Lamp Group

Group is a logical collection that grouping lamps could be treated as one logical item, in another way, bulk operation would be eaiser to implement. For an expiedent in an emergency,  such as an eclipse of the sun, you need to have a temporaty schedule in which there're only grouping lamps can be added. See [Section Emergency Control](../part2/config). This section provides information on how to group lamps.

### Add a Lamp Group

Select `Devices` - `Group` - `+ Add Group` , and click `Submit` after entering the group name in the popping-up dialog box , as the figure shown below.
![Add lamp group](img/device_addLampGroup.png 'Add lamp group')

>**Note**:
>1. When selecting a newly added group, all lamps are listed in the `Non-group lamp` box.
>2. The total member nunber of the group would be shown in a yellow circle icon followed.

### Edit the Name of a Lamp Group

Select `Devices` - `Group` , and select the target group in the list. Click the ![Edit the Group Name](img/Pensil.png 'Edit the Group Name') (pencil-shaped) button, to enter a new name for the group.  And then don't forget to click checkmark button to apply the change.

### Add/Remove Lamps to/from a Group

The  `group lamp` list of a newly added lamp group would be blank.

1. Select `Devices` - `Group`, and choose the target group.
2. Choose a lamp from the `non-group lamp` list and add itto the group by clicking  `>`. 
   Or, select the target lamp in the `group lamp` list and remove it from the group by clicking `<`, as shown in the figure below.
>**Tips**:
>
>1. Enter the name or any word contained in the name of the lamp into the filter to search rapidly in the `group lamp` or `non-group lamp` search box.
>2. Use`>>` or to add all lamps in the list into the group or `<<` to remove all lamps in the list from the group.

## After Actions Above

After the actions above, changing controller and lamps information: 

1. A restart is needed to tell the server fetching updating data. Select `Devices` - `Restart Service`, click the `restart` button.![Restart Service](img/device_restartService.png 'Restart Service')
2. Wait for the restarting and relogin once it is ready.
3. Push the changes to the target controllers. Select `Deivces` - `Release Settings`. Choose the relevant controllers (changes effected), and then click `Release`.

## Sensors Management

StarRvier system collects and keep one-day long record of all the sensors. You need to add at least one light sensor before creating any automatic-dimming plan. Or You could query the information of the sensors (except for the light sensor) in `Query` - `Sensor`. Before that, you need to add them to the system. The following sections provide instructions on sensor management. If you are looking for instruction of sensors in a intelligent lamp, see the Section [Intelligent Lamp][] - [Add a Sensor][].

### Add a Sensor

1. Select  `Devices` - `Sensor` - `+ Add sensor` to add a sensor.  A dialog box will pop up as shown in the figure below.
2. After filling the required fields, `Name` and `type`  in the dialogbox, click on `Submit` to apply the change.

   > **Tips**: StarRiver system has supports for the following sensor type: light sensor, people flow counter and traffic flow counter.
